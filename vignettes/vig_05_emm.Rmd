In this document, we demonstrate including effect measure modification (EMM) terms in the mediator or the outcome models. The dataset used in this document is still `vv2015`.

```{r}
library(regmedint)
library(tidyverse)
## Prepare dataset
data(vv2015)
```

# No EMM by covariates

In the first model fit, we do not include any EMM term.

# EMM by covariates

## There is $A\times C$ term in mediator model
Now suppose the covariate $C$ modifies the treatment effect on the mediator. We add `EMM_AC_Mmodel = c("c")` in `regmedint()`. Although there is only one covariate in our dataset, `EMM_AC_Mmodel` can take a vector of multiple covariates. Please note that the covariates in `EMM_AC_Mmodel` should be a subset of the covariates specified in `cvar`, i.e. if a covariate is an effect measure modifier included in `EMM_AC_Mmodel`, it must be included in `cvar`, otherwise an error message will be printed.

## There is $A\times C$ term in both mediator and outcome models
Now suppose in addition to the EMM on mediator, the covariate $C$ also modifies the treatment effect on the outcome We add `EMM_AC_Ymodel = c("c")` in `regmedint()`.  Please note that the covariates in `EMM_AC_Ymodel` should be a subset of the covariates specified in `cvar`, i.e. if a covariate is an effect measure modifier included in `EMM_AC_Ymodel`, it must be included in `cvar`, otherwise an error message will be printed.

## There are $A\times C$ term in both mediator and outcome models, and $M\times C$ term in outcome model
Now suppose in addition to the EMM of treatment effect, the covariate $C$ also modifies the mediator effect on the outcome. We add `EMM_MC = c("c")` in `regmedint()`.  Please note that the covariates in `EMM_MC` should be a subset of the covariates specified in `cvar`, i.e. if a covariate is an effect measure modifier included in `EMM_MC`, it must be included in `cvar`, otherwise an error message will be printed.
